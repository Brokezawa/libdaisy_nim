---

## Building and Running Examples

### Quick Start

```bash
cd examples

# Build specific example
sed -i "s/^TARGET = .*/TARGET = blink/" Makefile
make clean && make

# Flash to Daisy Seed
make program-dfu
```

### Test All Examples (Compilation Only)

```bash
cd examples
./test_all.sh

# Expected output (as of v0.14.0):
# ========================================
# SUMMARY:
#   Passed: 71
#   Failed: 0
# ========================================
```

### Build System Details

The build system uses:
- **Makefile** - Controls ARM GCC toolchain
- **nim.cfg** - Nim cross-compilation settings
- **TARGET variable** (line 9 of Makefile) - Selects which example to build

Build artifacts go into `build/` directory:
- `build/*.elf` - Executable with debug symbols
- `build/*.bin` - Binary for flashing
- `build/*.map` - Memory map

---

## Common Patterns

### Standard Initialization

All examples follow this pattern:

```nim
import ../src/libdaisy
import ../src/libdaisy_module  # If using specific peripheral

useDaisyNamespace()  # Macro for C++ includes

var hw: DaisySeed  # Global hardware object

proc main() =
  hw = initDaisy()  # Initialize hardware
  
  # Your setup code here
  
  while true:
    # Main loop
    hw.delay(100)

when isMainModule:
  main()
```

### Audio Callback Structure

```nim
proc audioCallback(input: ptr ptr cfloat, output: ptr ptr cfloat, size: csize_t) {.cdecl.} =
  ## Real-time audio processing
  ## RULES:
  ## - No allocations (no seq, no string)
  ## - No printing/logging
  ## - No delays or blocking calls
  ## - Keep processing fast and deterministic
  
  for i in 0..<size:
    # Process left channel
    output[0][i] = processLeft(input[0][i])
    # Process right channel
    output[1][i] = processRight(input[1][i])

proc main() =
  hw = initDaisy()
  hw.startAudio(audioCallback)  # Register callback
  
  while true:
    # Main loop runs independently from audio
    hw.delay(10)
```

### GPIO Pattern

```nim
var pin: GPIO

proc main() =
  hw = initDaisy()
  
  pin.init(DPin0, MODE_INPUT, PULL_UP)
  
  while true:
    let state = pin.read()
    hw.setLed(state)
    hw.delay(10)
```

### I2C Pattern

```nim
var i2c: I2CHandle

proc main() =
  hw = initDaisy()
  
  var cfg = createI2CConfig()
  cfg.periph = I2C_PERIPH_1
  cfg.speed = I2C_SPEED_400KHZ
  cfg.pin_config.scl = DPin11
  cfg.pin_config.sda = DPin12
  
  discard i2c.init(cfg)
  
  # Write to device
  discard i2c.transmitBlocking(0x3C, addr data, 1, 1000)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Compilation Issues

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Error: cannot open file 'libdaisy.nim'` | Wrong directory | Run from `examples/` directory |
| `undefined reference to daisy::DaisySeed` | libDaisy not built | `cd libDaisy && make` |
| `arm-none-eabi-gcc: command not found` | Toolchain not installed | Install ARM embedded toolchain |
| `Error: undeclared identifier` | Missing import | Add required `import ../src/libdaisy_*` |

### Flashing Issues

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `dfu-util: Cannot open DFU device` | Not in DFU mode | Hold BOOT, press RESET, release BOOT |
| `No DFU capable USB device available` | Driver issue (Windows) | Install Zadig drivers for DFU device |
| `Lost device after RESET` | Normal | Device rebooted - not an error |
| `Error during download` | Corrupted binary | `make clean && make` |

### Runtime Issues

#### No LED Activity

1. Check hardware initialization: `hw.init()`
2. Try `blink.nim` (simplest example)
3. Verify power supply (USB or external 3.3-5V)
4. Check for panic crash (LED might blink SOS pattern)

#### No Audio Output

1. Verify audio callback registered: `hw.startAudio(callback)`
2. Check audio cable connections (input and output)
3. Test with `sine_wave.nim` (doesn't need input)
4. Verify sample rate matches hardware (48kHz default)
5. Check volume level on amp/headphones

#### Peripheral Not Working

**I2C:**
- Run `i2c_scanner.nim` to detect devices
- Check pull-up resistors (4.7kΩ to 3.3V)
- Verify device address (7-bit: 0x3C, not 8-bit: 0x78)
- Check power supply to peripheral (3.3V or 5V)

**SPI:**
- Verify MOSI/MISO not swapped
- Check clock polarity/phase settings
- Confirm CS pin actively driven
- Scope the signals if available

**ADC:**
- Ensure voltage range 0-3.3V (exceeding may damage chip!)
- Check pot wiring (wiper to ADC pin, ends to GND/3.3V)
- Add 100nF capacitor for noise filtering
- Verify ADC pin supports analog input (A0-A11)

**PWM:**
- Confirm pin supports PWM (not all GPIO pins do)
- Check PWM frequency (visible flicker = too low)
- Verify duty cycle range (0-100%)
- Test with different pins if issue persists

### Performance Issues

**Audio Glitches/Clicks:**
- Audio callback taking too long
- Remove logging/printing from callback
- Reduce buffer processing complexity
- Increase audio buffer size (tradeoff: more latency)

**Slow Display Updates:**
- I2C speed too low (use 400kHz)
- Drawing too much per frame
- Use partial updates instead of full clears
- SPI faster than I2C for displays

**Controls Feel Sluggish:**
- Main loop has delays too large
- Reduce `hw.delay()` duration
- Use hardware timers for precise timing
- Check update rate in control library
